  <h1>Hi, my name is Nick Coffey and I'm a fullstack developer.</h1>

<p>
  I've been working as a web developer professionally since 2017 and love the constant learning and innovation that comes with building on the web.
  This blog is where I like to share new ideas, technologies, and discoveries I come across in my personal and professional projects.
